Senior Capstone Project, Fall 2019 - Sentiment Analysis: A Demonstration of Python Text Analytics - contributors: Stephen Schneider, Caitlin McOsker, Aaliyah Smith, Caleb Vandersall

This is the code, data, and final report for the senior IT capstone project created by authors Stephen Schneider, Caitlin McOsker, Aaliyah Smith, Caleb Vandersall in Fall 2019, College of Engineering and Computing, Georgia Southern University.

Abstract:
Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of Python and its libraries by performing a
sentiment analysis of Twitter data regarding opinions on the 2020 Democratic primary
candidates. We will use static and dynamic techniques to demonstrate the adaptability
of Python and determine the best way to analyze Twitter data. We will evaluate our
results by comparing them with traditional polling methods.
